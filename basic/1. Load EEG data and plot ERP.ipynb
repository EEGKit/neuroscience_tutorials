      "He picked one of these cards and kept it in his mind. Next, the 9 playing cards would flash one-by-one in a random order across the screen. Each card was presented a total of 30 times. The subject would mentally count the number of times his card would appear on the screen (which was 30 if he was paying attention, we are not interested in the answer he got, it just helps keep the subject focused on the cards).\n",

This results in relatively clean looking data. When doing ERP analysis on other data, you will probably have to filter it yourself. Don't do ERP analysis on non-filtered, non-baselined data! Bandpass filtering is covered in the 3rd tutorial."
