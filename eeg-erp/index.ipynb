    "Through this interface, your laptop is currently talking to some server in the cloud.\n",
    "The server holds the MEG data I've prepared for you and will do the actual computational work, sending the results back to your browser.\n",

    "The way we talk with the server is through Python code.\n",
    "That's right, you will do some programming!\n",
    "I'll try to guide you through everything.\n",
    "Our objective will be to perform a simple Event-Related Potential (ERP) analysis of some EEG data.\n",
